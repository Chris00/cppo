                          cppo: cpp for OCaml
                          -------------------

Features
========

Cppo is an equivalent of the C preprocessor for OCaml programs.
It allows defining simple macros and file inclusion.

Cppo is:

- OCaml-friendly (unlike cpp)
- easy to learn without consulting a manual (unlike m4 or camlp4)
- reasonably fast (unlike camlmix)
- simple to install and to maintain (unlike camlp4-based tools)



Syntax
